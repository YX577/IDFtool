Description: IDFTool computes intensity-duration-frequency curves per specific time duration and different return periods. 
          The intensity-duration-frequency curves are used in hydrology to express in a synthetic way, 
          fixed a return period T and a duration d of a rainfall event. IDF Tool included an uncertainty analysis in PDFs and IDF curves, by bootstrap method.
