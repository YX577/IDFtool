Description: IDFtool computes intensity-duration-frequency curves per specific
    time duration and different return periods. The intensity-duration-frequency curves 
    are used in hydrology to express in a synthetic way, fixed a return period T and a 
    duration d of a rainfall event. IDFTool included an uncertainty 
    analysis in PDFs and IDF curves, by bootstrap method.
