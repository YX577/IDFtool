Description: Intensity-duration-frequency curves are computed per specific
    time duration and different return periods and can be fitted to eight different PDFs. The intensity-duration-frequency curves 
    are used in hydrology to express in a synthetic way, fixed a return period T and a 
    duration d of a rainfall event. IDFtool included an uncertainty 
    analysis in PDFs and IDF curves, by means of a bootstrapping method. See Davison and Hinkley (1997), <doi: 10.2307/1271471>.
